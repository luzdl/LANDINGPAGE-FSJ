# LANDINGPAGE-FSJ

Landing page, project for Kodigo's Fullstack Bootcamp

Responsive discount landing page for a store made on HTML and CSS

## Color palette

1. **Primary Color**: `#962727`  
   This color is used on various elements, such as the background of the navigation bar (`header`), the text in certain links (`navbar a:hover::before` in mobile view), and the borders of `storeItem`, as well as the color of the `.itemPrice` class. Itâ€™s a dark red that conveys a sense of formality and seriousness.

2. **Soft White**: `whitesmoke`  
   Used as the background in `main`, `homeImages`, and several other elements to highlight images and text without being pure white, adding softness and elegance.

3. **Shadows and Transparencies**:  
   - Light black shadows with low opacity (`rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`) enhance the `box-shadow` effect in various elements.
   - The color `rgba(245, 184, 196, 0.5)` in the background of `.storeItem` adds a soft, warm touch to the design.

4. **Text Colors - Whitesmoke and Black**:  
   Used for the `Logo` text, `navbar`, and other `saleText` elements, providing good contrast with the background.
